Suspicious Process Monitor - README

Project Overview

The Suspicious Process Monitor is a real-time security tool designed for SOC analysts, cybersecurity professionals, and system administrators. It detects, logs, and terminates suspicious processes running on a machine by leveraging process name detection, SHA-256 hashing, and VirusTotal API integration to identify malicious behavior.

Features
âœ” Real-time process monitoring â€“ Scans active processes for suspicious behavior.
âœ” Automatic threat termination â€“ Instantly terminates flagged processes.
âœ” SHA-256 Hash Calculation â€“ Computes file hashes for deeper malware analysis.
âœ” VirusTotal API integration â€“ Cross-checks process hashes with a global threat intelligence database.
âœ” Logging system â€“ Stores detected threats in a CSV log for forensic analysis.
âœ” Lightweight & efficient â€“ Runs in the background with minimal system impact.

Installation
1. Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system. Install required dependencies:

pip install psutil pandas requests

2. Configure VirusTotal API (Optional but Recommended)

To enable VirusTotal API scanning, obtain an API key from VirusTotal and add it to the script:

VT_API_KEY = "your_virustotal_api_key"

How to Run the Program

1. Running the Script

Simply execute the script:

python suspicious_process_monitor.py

The tool will continuously monitor running processes and log any suspicious activity.

2. Output & Logs

If a suspicious process is found, it will be terminated automatically.

All flagged processes will be logged in suspicious_processes.log.

Example log entry:

Time,PID,Process Name,Command Line,File Path,SHA-256 Hash,VirusTotal Detection
2024-03-15 10:30:00,1234,cmd.exe,/c powershell,C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe,3a4f...d78c,Detected by 5 AVs

How the Program Works

1. Process Name & Command-Line Scanning

The script checks each running process against a predefined list of malicious keywords (mimikatz, powershell, nc.exe, etc.).

If a match is found, the process is flagged for review.

2. SHA-256 Hashing & VirusTotal Lookup

The executable file of each suspicious process is hashed using SHA-256.

The hash is then sent to VirusTotal API to check if the process is known malware.

3. Automatic Process Termination

If a process is deemed malicious, it is terminated immediately to prevent further execution.

Customization Options

Modify Suspicious Keywords

To add more keywords, edit the SUSPICIOUS_KEYWORDS list in the script:

SUSPICIOUS_KEYWORDS = ["mimikatz", "nc.exe", "malware.exe", "backdoor"]

Disable Process Termination

If you only want to log threats without killing processes, comment out this line:

terminate_process(proc.info['pid'])

Change Log File Location

Modify the log file path in LOG_FILE:

LOG_FILE = "/var/logs/suspicious_processes.log"  # Linux path example

Use Cases

âœ” SOC Threat Hunting â€“ Detect malicious tools running on corporate endpoints.
âœ” Incident Response â€“ Kill ransomware or unauthorized access processes in real-time.
âœ” System Monitoring â€“ Track anomalies in production environments.
âœ” Forensic Analysis â€“ Store logs for post-attack investigations.
